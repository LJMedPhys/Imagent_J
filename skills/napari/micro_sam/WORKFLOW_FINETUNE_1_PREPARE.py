micro_sam fine-tuning — STAGE 1 of 4: build the annotation task.

Turns a folder of images into a small set of SMALL SQUARE TILES that a human can annotate
completely in a few minutes each, and pre-segments every tile with the stock model so the
human CORRECTS a first guess instead of drawing from scratch.

WHY TILES: micro_sam can only train its automatic-instance-segmentation (AIS) decoder on
DENSELY annotated data — every object inside the annotated field must be labelled, because
anything left unlabelled is taught to the decoder as background. Annotating every cell in a
full field is hours of work. Annotating every cell inside a 512x512 tile is 1-3 minutes, and
a tile IS dense. So the user never annotates all cells in an image; they annotate all cells
in a few small squares. That is the whole trick, and it is what makes this workflow tractable.
(micro_sam's own docs: "It's okay to use sparse segmentations ... for just finetuning Segment
Anything WITHOUT the additional decoder" — sparse costs you AIS, i.e. hands-off batch
segmentation. Tiles keep AIS.)

WHO PICKS THE TILES: the human, by clicking (PICK_MODE = "interactive", the default). A napari
window walks through one sample field per group — per well, per condition, per plate, whatever
GROUP_REGEX says — and the user clicks where the tile should sit. Two or three minutes, and it
removes the single biggest failure mode of this workflow: an automatic content score CANNOT
tell a 2 um dust speck from a 12 um nucleus, so on real slides it happily hands the annotator
a field of stain precipitate (many "objects", zero cells) or an out-of-focus haze. A human
sees the difference in half a second. Set PICK_MODE = "auto" only for unattended runs, and
then LOOK at previews/ before letting anyone annotate.

Outputs (all under TASK_DIR):
    tiles/tile_00000.tif            the 8-bit image crops the human will annotate
    presegmentation/tile_00000.tif  stock-model first guess, loaded into the annotator
    previews/tile_00000.png         raw + outline overlay, so the agent can look at it
    annotations/                    EMPTY — stage 2 fills it, one TIFF per finished tile
    manifest.json                   everything stages 2/3/4 need. Do not hand-edit.
    ANNOTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md      the human-facing instructions, with real numbers in them

Next: WORKFLOW_FINETUNE_2_ANNOTATE.py

You are teaching the computer what a correct segmentation looks like. It has made a first
guess; your job is to fix it on **{n} small squares** ({tile} x {tile} pixels each,
about {per:.0f} objects per square). Roughly {2 * n}-{4 * n} minutes in total.

You do **not** annotate whole images and you do **not** annotate every cell in your dataset —
only everything inside these {n} small squares.

## The one rule

Inside the square, **every object must be outlined, and nothing else may be**.
Miss one and the computer learns "that is background". If an object is cut off by the edge of
the square, still include it.

**Leave the outlines that already look right alone.** You are checking the computer's work, not
redrawing it — an outline that follows the object is a correct answer even if you would have
drawn it a pixel or two differently. Only touch an outline that is clearly wrong: it covers two
objects, it covers half of one, or it is on something that is not an object at all.

## The window

A napari window opens with two layers listed on the left:

| layer | what it is |
|---|---|
| `image` | the tile |
| `committed_objects` | the computer's guess — one colour per object. **This is your answer sheet.** |

The **ImagentJ — Annotation Helper** panel on the right has everything you need: a tile
counter and four buttons. Use the buttons — they put napari into the right mode for you,
which is the one thing that is easy to get wrong.

## Three things to do

### ➕ ADD a missing object
1. Click **➕ ADD objects** in the helper panel (it turns green).
2. Left-click once **in the middle** of the object.
3. Press **S** → the outline appears (in `current_object`).
   - grabbed the neighbour too, or too much background? Press **T**, click on the part it
     should *not* include, press **S** again, then press **T** to go back.
   - still wrong? Press **Shift+C** to clear and start that object again.
4. Press **C** → the object turns into a new colour and joins `committed_objects`. Done.

> **Pressed C and nothing happened?** The thing you clicked is already outlined. The tool
> refuses to draw on top of an existing object — delete that outline first, then add it again.

### ✏ DRAW an outline by hand
Use this when **ADD will not cooperate** — two objects that keep coming out as one, or an
outline the computer gets wrong however you click it.

1. Click **✏ DRAW outline** in the helper panel (it turns purple).
2. Click once at each corner all the way around the object.
3. **Double-click** to close it → the shape fills in as a new object.
   - misclicked? Right-click removes the last point; **Esc** abandons the shape.

No **S**, no **C** — those belong to ADD. What you draw goes straight onto the answer sheet.
Your outline only has to follow the object roughly; a dozen clicks around it is plenty.

### ✖ DELETE a wrong object
1. Click **✖ DELETE objects** in the helper panel (it turns red).
2. Click on the wrong object → it disappears.

(Or just hover the mouse over it and press **D**.)

Delete anything that is not a real object (debris, dirt, a shadow), and anything the computer
got badly wrong. **To fix a bad outline, delete it and add it again** — that is faster and
safer than trying to repair it:

| problem | fix |
|---|---|
| object missing | ADD it |
| debris / background outlined | DELETE it |
| one outline covers two objects | DELETE it, then ADD each object separately |
| one object split into two outlines | DELETE both, then ADD it with one click |
| outline is badly off | DELETE it, then ADD it again |
| ADD keeps getting the same object wrong | DELETE it, then **DRAW** it |
| objects packed tightly together | DELETE the clump, then **DRAW** each one |

> **Tight clumps are what DRAW is for.** One click inside a clump gives you the whole clump,
> and once that is committed every further click inside it is ignored — clicking more will
> not help. Draw them by hand instead. If a clump is so dense that you cannot tell where one
> object ends and the next begins, leave it out and say so to whoever asked: a guess there is
> worse for training than nothing, because the computer learns the guess.

## Finishing a tile

Click **✓ TILE DONE → NEXT TILE** (or press **N**).

> ⚠ **Press N on every tile, including the LAST one.** N is what saves your work. Closing the
> window without pressing N loses that tile. After the last one, napari asks
> "Do you wish to close napari?" — click **Yes**.

If a square genuinely has nothing in it, N asks *"Nothing is segmented yet. Do you wish to
continue to the next image?"* — click **OK**. That is the tool checking you did not forget the
tile, not an error.

Everything is saved tile by tile, so you can stop any time and pick up where you left off:
already-finished tiles are skipped when the annotator is restarted.
