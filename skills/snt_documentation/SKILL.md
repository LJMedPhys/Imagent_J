description: SNT is Fiji's framework for semi-automated neurite tracing, SWC reconstruction I/O, neuronal morphometry, Sholl analysis, graph theory analysis, brain atlas integration, online database access, and batch reconstruction analysis. Use this skill for manual tracing in the SNT GUI, importing or exporting SWC/TRACES files, scripting morphometry and Sholl analysis, graph-theoretic measurements, compartment-specific analysis, batch analysis of SWC directories, downloading reconstructions from NeuroMorpho.org or MouseLight, and analyzing brain area projections in the Allen CCF.

# SNT - Documentation Index

SNT combines interactive tracing, reconstruction import and export, morphometric analysis, Sholl analysis, graph theory, brain atlas integration, online database access, and batch reconstruction processing. The validated automation path in this repo uses the SNT Java API directly (`Tree`, `TreeStatistics`, `ShollAnalyzer`, `TreeParser`, `LinearProfileStats`, `DirectedWeightedGraph`, `MouseLightLoader`, `NeuroMorphoLoader`, `AllenUtils`, `SNTTable`) rather than dialog-driving macros.

## Automation Boundary

- **Headless-safe**: all checked-in Groovy workflows produce CSV/SWC output without requiring a display.
- **GUI workflows**: interactive tracing, path editing, Sholl dialogs, 3D viewers, chart `.show()` calls, StrahlerCmd, and GroupAnalyzerCmd require a display context.
- This skill does not claim an end-to-end `IJ.run()` macro string for driving SNT tracing dialogs.

## Workflow Bootstrap

- Analysis workflows require an explicit `inputSwcFile`.
- Use your own SWC reconstruction, or first run `GROOVY_WORKFLOW_EXPORT_DEMO_TREE_AS_SWC.groovy`.
- The export workflow writes a demo reconstruction to `/data/snt_validation/demo_tree_from_service.swc` by default.
